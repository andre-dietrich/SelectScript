# SelectScript_Base

This is the SelectScript base, which offers only a language stub. It can be
used and extended to generate any kind of interface to any other discrete
simulation environment.

Currently available interfaces are:

1. SelectScript_ODE
2. SelectScript_OpenRAVE

Check their implementation, to see, how simple it is to derive a new dialect.

## Installation

then via Python setuptools:
```
$ sudo python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
```
